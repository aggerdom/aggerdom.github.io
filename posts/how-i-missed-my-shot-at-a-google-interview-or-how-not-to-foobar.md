It was the week before midterms a few months back. At the time, I was up to my ankles with studying and finishing my thesis, and was working on some code when I found myself Googling the documentation for the itertools python module. What happened next was surprising, and in my case unfortunate: I received the invitation for "foo.bar". 

So what is FooBar? Apparently at a point in early 2015, Google was on a hiring binge. In the aim of attracting qualified developers, they decided to follow in the footsteps of numerous companies in the past, and opted for a viral marketing campaign [0]. The way that the campaign works presumed to be as follows: Based upon the terms that a user is searching for (along with almost certainly along with other factors), Google may decide to extend an invitation to participate in a series of coding challenges. Candidates who successfully complete the challenges are contacted by a recruiter, and asked to submit their resume or CV.

When a user has been selected to participate in the challenges, they will be forwarded through to the results page for their search. Then, something unexpected will happen. The search bar will fold up. And the results will fold down to reveil the message in the image below.

I excitedly clicked "I want to play", and was dropped into a simulation of a linux terminal session. Once a user is dropped into the terminal, they use their knowledge of the command line to move forwards and begin to solve a series of challenges. Once a challenge is accepted, they have a set ammount of time to finish the tasks for that particular challenge.

And so there you have it, how not to FooBar.
Prolemic to anyone that finds themselves in this situation. Just know, if you decide to play, you can't go back.
