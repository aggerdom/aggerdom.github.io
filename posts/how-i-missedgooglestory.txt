.. topic:: Introduction to the story

    .. compound::
        It was the week before midterms a few months back. At the time, I was up
        to my ankles with studying and finishing my thesis, and was working on
        some code when I found myself Googling the documentation for the
        itertools python module. What happened next was surprising, and in my
        case unfortunate: I received the invitation for "foo.bar".

        Many nights
