A good time management tool can be invaluable. But its too easy to get sucked into spending time trying to figure out how to regiment your time. The system that I've found to work best for me is a small program called "Instant Boss". You give it the number of minutes you would like to work for, the number of minutes you would like to break for, and the number of times you would like to repeat the process. And it will display a countdown timer, and play a sound effect when time is up. Work for 10 minutes. Break for two minutes. Repeat...
