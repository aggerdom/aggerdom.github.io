I took a topics course on Facial Perception last year, and had actually been thinking about the issue a little at the time. I ended up giving a presentation on Robin Thomas’ 2001 paper “Characterizing Perceptual Interactions in Face Identification Using Multidimensional Signal Detection Theory” as part of the course, and I could see how it could suggest problems for Chernoff faces. The paper was somewhat hard to find if I remember correctly, so I’ll have to update with the volume it was published in when I get home.

When dealing with multivariate data with more than a few dimensions, visualizing the data in a cogent way can be difficult. If you want to ... scatterplot. Color, shape of data points, and other features... However while reading AUTHOR's book "BOOKNAME", I saw for the first time perhaps one of the most interesting approaches I've seen: Chernoff faces. 

# Overview of what they are

# Problem with Chernoff Faces

- What follows is a post that I've been wanting to write this post for some time now,
- I first started thinking about this issue in YEAR while taking a topics course of facial perception taught by James Townsend. While the conclusions that I come to should be seen as speculative, there seems to be enough to go on to speculate.

Perceptual and decisional independence

Introduction of perceptual decencies would seem to complicate thing for Chernoff faces.





The study made use of schematic faces, that held facial contour constant. The setup varied eye separation, nose length, and mouth width with each of 3 subjects receiving 4 possible configurations to distinguish between. Responses were collected in observation-confusion matrices?(I’ll have to check, might be identification-confusion?). In any case, they found perceptual dependency between eye separation and nose length. As well as between nose length and mouth width. One of the interpretations given was that the perceptual system maintains area over a triangle of bordering features (if the nose is perceived as longer then the eye separation will perceived as wider).
