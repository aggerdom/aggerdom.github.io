For awhile now, I have been interested in collecting great educational videos and resources on this blog. Currently, I have various links to resources available under the "Lists-O-Links" tab in the navigation bar, but I'm still searching for the right format. But today I would like to take a few minutes to highlight a few really great educational video series I've come across on YouTube that have really impressed me.

## Computerphile ([YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile))

Features short videos (typically 4-8 minutes) on various computer related topics such as Chomsky's Hierarchy and computer vision. 

## Numberphile ([YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile))

Sister channel to Computerphile. Features short videos (typically 4-8 minutes) on numbers.

## Introduction To Higher Mathematics Video Series ([YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX))

A great video series I started working my way through last summer. Bill Shillito's "Introduction To Higher Mathematics" video series introduces the viewer to concepts in mathematics such as modular arithmetic, topology, and group theory. 

## Chaos - A mathematical adventure([Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLelIK3uylPMHTEZ0hEx3PshdSx6awKmxa))

9 part video series that features animations explaining concepts related to chaos theory and dynamic systems. 


## Carneades.org ([Website](http://www.carneades.org/), [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/carneadesofcyrene))

Carneades.org is a great YouTube series on philosophical topics that is worth checking out for anyone interested in learning more about formal logic. They have been running a fantastic "100 Days of Logic" series covering categorical logic, predicate calculus, various modal logics, ect. If that sounds like something that you would like to learn more about: [www.carneades.org](http://www.carneades.org/) is a good portal to a lot of their video series, and all the videos can be found at their YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/carneadesofcyrene).

## Flame0430([YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/flame0430))

Flame0430's YouTube Channel hosts a really fantastic series of interviews with leading philosophers such as W.V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Bernard Williams, A.J Ayer, and more.
