## Introduction

- [RegexOne](http://regexone.com/)
    + This is the page that I learned regular expressions from. As best I can tell, the site teaches you Javascript flavored regular expressions (Or Regex for short.) RegexOne does a good job of segmenting the lessons into bite sized pieces and can get you up and running with regular expressions in an afternoon. If someone wanted to learn about regular expressions for whatever their programming language of choice is (mine is python), I would recommend starting by working through the lessons on RegexOne, and then learning how their particular language of choice works with regular expressions.
